# Handy BASH scrips for working with Lacework

## lw_aws_inventory.sh
Script for estimating license vCPUs in an AWS environment. It leverages the AWS CLI and leverages by default the default profile thatâ€™s either configured using environment variables or configuration files in the ~/.aws folder. The script provides output in a CSV format to be imported into a spreadsheet, as well as an easy-to-read summary.

Note the following about the script:
* It requires AWS CLI v2 to run
* It has been verified to work on Mac and Linux based systems
* It works great in a cloud shell
* It does not work on Windows (Cygwin), but has been observed to work with Windows Subsystem for Linux.
* Run using the following syntax: ./lw_aws_inventory.sh, sh lw_aws_inventory.sh will not work

The output from running the script can look as follows:
```
./lw_aws_inventory.sh -p admin-account -o -r us-east-1

The following options can be used to modify how the script is run:
### Specify one or more account profiles to scan using -p parameter
```
./lw_aws_inventory.sh -p default,lw-customerdemo
```
### Specify what regions to scan, to speed up scanning or avoid restricted regions
```
./lw_aws_inventory.sh -r us-east-1,us-east-2
```
### Scan all accounts in an AWS Organization
```
./lw_aws_inventory.sh -o OrganizationAccountAccessRole
```
This will leverage the OrganizationAccountAccessRole to scan all accounts in an organization.

## lw_gcp_inventory.sh
Script for estimating license vCPUs in a GCP environment, based on folder, project or organization level. 

Note the following about the script:
* It does not work on Windows
* It has only been verified to work on Mac and Linux based systems
* It works great in a cloud shell

```
$ ./lw_gcp_inventory.sh -help
Usage: ./lw_gcp_inventory.sh [-f folder] [-o organization] [-p project]
Any single scope can have multiple values comma delimited, but multiple scopes cannot be defined.
```

By default, the script will scan any project that the user has access to:
```
$ ./lw_gcp_inventory.sh
"Project", "VM Count", "vCPUs"
"projects/project-one", 2, 8
"projects/project-two", 3, 12

vCPUs:                                 20
```

The scope of the scan can be further refined using the -f, -o or -p parameters:
```
$ ./lw_gcp_inventory.sh -p project-one,project-two
"Project", "VM Count", "vCPUs"
"projects/project-one", 2, 8

## lw_azure_inventory.sh
Script for estimating license vCPUs in an Azure environment, based on folder, project or organization level. 

Note the following about the script:
* It does not work on Windows
* It has only been verified to work on Mac and Linux based systems
* It works great in a cloud shell

```
./lw_azure_inventory.sh -help
Usage: ./lw_azure_inventory.sh [-m management_group] [-s subscription]
Any single scope can have multiple values comma delimited, but multiple scopes cannot be defined.
```

By default, the script will scan any subscriptions the user has configured access to:
